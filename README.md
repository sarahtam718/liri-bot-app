## What is LIRI?
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI except instead of being a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Why is LIRI useful?
The user can look up concerts for favorite artists to see when they'll be in town, or call details for  songs to know more about them and get a preview, or look up movies to see if they might be an interesting watch!

## How do I get started using LIRI?
To get started, the user will have to use their own spotify API key. From there, run the liri.js file in node and there will be 2 questions prompted. The first one asks for the command. The user may type in the following to find data for concerts, songs, movies, and a pleasant surprise (respectively):
    a. concert-this
    b. spotify-this-song
    c. movie-this
    d. do-what-it-says
The second question asks the user for the artist, song, or movie to search. The user can either enter their desired medium (only one at a time) or enter nothing and receive the default data. Choose the default for "do-what-it-says".
